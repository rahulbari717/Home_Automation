# Home_Automation
This project demonstrates a home automation system where household appliances like lights and fans can be controlled electronically using a microcontroller. The system receives user commands through an interface such as buttons, a mobile app, or wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) and switches appliances ON or OFF accordingly.
